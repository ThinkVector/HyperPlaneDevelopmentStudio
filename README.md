Additional machine and computerized mathematical methods: 

	Angles on 90' 90' dimension:
	These techniques are amazing in machines and computerized systems.
	It is quite difficult to solve it manually (by hand).

		c1 and d1 alike a and b. It is meant to facilitate 
		calculations in computer environment, without confusion.)
		
			root(a+b) = root(2)
		
			a goes to 0 to 2
			b goes to 2 to 0
		
			a goes to 2 to 0
			b goes to 0 to 2

			___45°___
			a = 2 { 1 <= a <= 2 : step=0.00001 }
			b = 2 - a
			_________
			a1 = sqrt( a )
			b1 = sqrt( b )
			________
			AB ( a1 , b1) point gives cartesian points.
			AB ( a1 , b1) series gives 0° to 45° degre of a 360° degre.
			8 X AB ( a1 , b1) series give 8 X 1/8 degre of 1 angle infinity.

In near future: 

	Nir cube of 9D unreal meta prime reality 
	will support to us. Nowadays, like 
	90' 90' of 2D unreal meta prime reality.
	Then, unreal meta sphere easy to manage.
	
	In the vector of prime set (VP, VPR, VUP, VUPR, VDP, VDPR)
	most power of this set VP, next VUP. VUP is UNREAL DAUGHTER 
	PRIME for generally call for it's male kind prime's. VUP is 
	generally UNREAL DAUGHTER PRIME for this call for 
	it's male kind prime. 2D Hyper Mekanik Dimension call next
	90' 90' - 2D unreal daughter dimension method.
