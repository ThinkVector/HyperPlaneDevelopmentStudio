Additional machine and computerized mathematical methods: 

	Angles on 90' 90' dimension:
	These techniques are amazing in machines and computerized systems. It is quite difficult to solve it manually (by hand).

		0° to 45° degree auto division completion:
		
			root(a+b) = root(2)
		
			a goes to 0 to 2
			b goes to 2 to 0
		
			a goes to 2 to 0
			b goes to 0 to 2
		
		
		0° to 30° and 0° to 60° degree auto division completion:
		
			root(a+b) = root(3)
		
			a goes to 0 to 3
			b goes to 3 to 0
		
			a goes to 3 to 0
			b goes to 0 to 3
