Additional machine and computerized mathematical methods: 

	Angles on 90' 90' dimension:
	These techniques are amazing in machines and computerized systems.
	It is quite difficult to solve it manually (by hand).

		0° to 45° degree auto division completion:
		(Angle 1/8 true in infinity division. 1 angle = 360° degree.
		In this work https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rugmr8viqi
		c1 and d1 alike a and b. It is meant to facilitate 
		calculations in computer environment, without confusion.)
		
			root(a+b) = root(2)
		
			a goes to 0 to 2
			b goes to 2 to 0
		
			a goes to 2 to 0
			b goes to 0 to 2

			___45°___
			a = 2 { 1 <= a <= 2 : step=0.00001 }
			b = 2 - a
			_________
			a1 = sqrt( a )
			b1 = sqrt( b )
			________
			AB ( a1 , b1) point gives cartesian points.
			AB ( a1 , b1) series gives 0° to 45° degree of a 360° degree.
			8 X AB ( a1 , b1) series give 8 X 1/8 degree of 1 angle infinity.
			This Order: 2D: VUP Auto 1/4, then, 1/8, then 1/16, 1/32 and so its 
			cartesian. Its cartesians also special of its angular knowledge?

		0° to 30° and 0° to 60° degree auto division completion:
		(Angle 1/6 and 1/12 true in infinity division. 1 angle = 360° degree.

		c1 and d1 alike a and b. It is meant to facilitate 
		calculations in computer environment, without confusion.)
		
			root(a+b) = root(3)
		
			a goes to 0 to 3
			b goes to 3 to 0
		
			a goes to 3 to 0
			b goes to 0 to 3

			___30°___
			a = 2 { 3/2 <= a <= 2 : step=0.00001 }
			b = 2 - a
			_________
			a1 = sqrt( a )
			b1 = sqrt( b )
			_________
			AB ( a1 , b1) point gives cartesian points.
			AB ( a1 , b1) series gives 0° to 30° degre of a 360° degree.
			12 X AB ( a1 , b1) series give 12 X 1/12 degree of 1 angle infinity.

			___60°___
			a = 4 { 1 <= a <= 4 : step=0.00001 }
			b = 4 - a
			_________
			a1 = sqrt( a )
			b1 = sqrt( b )
			_________
			AB ( a1 , b1) point gives cartesian points.
			AB ( a1 , b1) series gives 0° to 60° degree of a 360° degree.
			6 X AB ( a1 , b1) series give 6 X 1/6 degree of 1 angle infinity.

Additional 6D cosmic shell methods:

	Hardware Vertical and Horizontal Plane (HVHP):
	Computer science hardware developments and extensions plane.
	CPU, GPU, RAM, STORAGE, CONNECTIONS, SOUND, MAINBOARD.
	Variety type for each need 1/1 mainplane, and 6/6 subplane.
	Sample: "Subplane ALU 1/6, and 5/6 subplane GPU, also 1/1 mainplane GPU."
	Sample: "Maintain and best re-creation is most important."

In near future: 

	Nir cube of 9D unreal meta prime reality 
	will support to us. Nowadays, like 
	90' 90' of 2D unreal meta prime reality.
	Then, unreal meta sphere easy to manage.
	
	In the vector of prime set (VP, VPR, VUP, VUPR, VDP, VDPR)
	most power of this set VP, next VUP. VUP is generally UNREAL DAUGHTER 
	PRIME call for it's male kind prime's. 2D Hyper Mechanic Dimension call next
	90' 90' - 2D unreal daughter dimension method.


True in all the time:

	* "VECTOR" kind of UNREAL META PRIME (VUP) reality.
	* Angle 1/4 true in infinity division.
	* Angle 1/8 true in infinity division.
	* Angle 1/12 true in infinity division.
